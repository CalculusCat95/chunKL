# chunkl

## About

chunkl is a gui-based software development toolkit created by CalculusCat95 and C0LateralD4mage. The backend and file operations are implemented in Python and the gui is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript. The gui is built with the CEFPython3 library. This repository does not currently accept external pull requests, however this *may* change in the future (subject to the decision of the developers). We chose the name 'chunkl' (it's lowercase on purpose) because we couldn't think of anything better. 

## Code Formatting

### Comments

Comments on a specific line of code are placed after the line. Comments on a group of lines are placed on their own line before the group. A multi- line comment summarizing what the file does is placed at the beginning of each film. 

### Line Spacing

A newline is inserted between every a group of similar lines. A group can contain only one line. It's ok if this spread the code out somewhat; it helps with readability. 

### Modularization

Code is seperated into modules based on function; code that does similar stuff is groupef together. 

## Indentation

This seems to be a fairly controversial subject. In this project, indents should be 4 spaces in Python, Javascript,  and CSS. HTML should be indented with 2 spaces.
